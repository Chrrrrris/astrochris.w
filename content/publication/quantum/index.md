abstract: Quantum computers have tremendous potential of simulating large quantum systems that classical computers can’t. In the theoretical verification of quantum non-locality principle, Bell’s and Mermin’s inequalities stood out, which proved to be valid in multiple empirical experiments. In this paper we report the tests of Bell and Mermin’s inequalities carried out on the 2- qubit and 3-qubit IBM quantum computer respectively. By comparing the result we obtained and the pattern predicted by the inequalities, our experimental results indicate clear violations of the two inequalities; thereby, we validate postulates in quantum mechanics and disprove the local realism argument in classical hidden variable theories proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen on quantum circuits.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
