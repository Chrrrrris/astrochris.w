I like to use various observatories to take photos of the night sky. 


<h1 id=solar-eclipse>2024 Solar Eclipse, Baltimore, 90% Coverage</h1><p><img src=./Eclipse.JPG style="max-width: 50%;" alt="eclipse" >I observed the 2024 solar eclipse at JHU, Baltimore on April 8, 2024. The maximum coverage is approximately 90%. The event is captured with my personal camera Nikon D7100, equipped with a 140mm lens and a UV filter. </p>

<h1 id=m51>M51</h1><p><img src=./M51.JPG style="max-width: 50%;" alt="M51 APO" >We observed M51, the whirlpool galaxy, with the 3.5m Apache Point Observatory on Mar.12, 2024. The overwhelming reddish color are from h-alpha filter, corresponds to booming star formation✨! The image consists of two 50-second exposures through the SDSS g’ filter, three 50-second exposures through the i' filter, and three 100-second exposures in an Halpha filter.
